# Aug 12
Goal: build a small Flask demo showing session-based recommendations using GRU4Rec (train small model or reuse Yoochoose checkpoint).
Early decision: create a tiny synthetic dataset for items a–f, train a CPU GRU4Rec model, and serve it via the web_demo.
Artifacts proposed/added:
generate_synth_af.py to create/train a tiny model (af_synth_model.pt) and mapping csv.
recommender.py wrapper to load model and expose recommend(session_items, topk).
Flask app (web_demo/app.py) integration that tracks session history, logs interactions, and shows top-k recommendations.
Run notes (Windows): commands to train in GRU4Rec repo and to start Flask app in web_demo; reminder to ensure PYTHONPATH or install package so gru4rec_pytorch is importable.

# Aug 13 updates: 
consolidated GRU4Rec code into gru4rec_torch, fixed sys.path import issues, added model inspection tooling (inspect_model.py), ensured model.eval() and error reporting in recommender.

# Aug 14 updates: 
switched to Yoochoose checkpoint (save_model_test.pt) for demo; patched imports and packaging; dynamic PRODUCTS generation; restored/enhanced interaction logging; added /log_click and /submit-checkout endpoints; recommender tested (catalog ~37.8k).

# Aug 15 updates: 
major preprocessing.py improvements:
robust timestamp parsing (_ensure_datetime_series), separator auto-detect, flexible path handling, dtype validation, safer CLI, returns (splits, idx_map).
Guidance: keep preprocessing offline (do not call per web request).

# Aug 17 updates: 
stabilized interaction logging (CSV header, timestamp, session UUID), per-client session UUID stored, fallback secret_key, UI fixes (topk=3, normalize IDs, _product_for_id stub), cluster plumbing skeleton added, recommendation fallback when history empty.
Current state: working session-based web demo that loads a pretrained GRU4Rec model, records richer interactions, and serves recommendations; preprocessing and clustering improvements are implemented but run offline.
Risks / next steps suggested:
Add session UUID persistently, popularity fallback, admin endpoint to retrain & reload, improve catalog size/metadata, finish clustering (use MiniBatchKMeans), and avoid running preprocessing on each request.

Summary

Kept the large catalog in the recommender but avoided materializing it in the UI. Added paginated products API and client-side page loading. Fixed clickable recommendation items not resolving to product pages by caching lightweight stubs.
Work completed today

Server

Added paginated /products endpoint that accepts page & size and returns items + total.
Implemented _build_products(limit, offset) to slice recommender.itemidmap without building full list.
Made CATALOG_MAX determined lazily from recommender (len(itemidmap)) so "total" is available without materializing items.
Ensured interaction logging writes timestamp, session UUID, event type, item id, history length to data/interactions.csv.
Added logic in product_page to create and cache lightweight product stubs in global RECOMMENDATIONS so recommendation links resolve.
Loaded item cluster map on startup and exposed /clusters endpoint that groups PRODUCTS by cluster if available.
Kept offline preprocessing / clustering guidance: heavy ops are not run per-request.
Frontend

Added script (index.html) to fetch /products?page=N&size=M and append results to #product-grid (initial page + infinite scroll).
Logged visible product/recommendation IDs via /log_click to capture impressions.
Model / data

Recommender continues to load pretrained checkpoint model (model/gru4rec_torch/output_data/save_model_test.pt).
Catalog metadata remains lightweight stubs; full metadata can be backed by DB/disk in future.
Cluster CSV (yoochoose_item_clusters.csv) loaded if present to help candidate narrowing.
Verification / quick tests performed

curl /products?page=0&size=10 returns items + total.
Index page loads first page of products and infinite scroll triggers additional pages.
Clicking recommended item now resolves to a product page (stub created & cached) instead of 404 / not found.
Risks / follow-ups (next steps)

Add server-side caching for popular pages and rate-limit /products to avoid high load under concurrent requests.
Implement popularity-based fallback / precomputed candidate pools to avoid scoring entire catalog per request.
Export embeddings + add FAISS/ANN for fast candidate retrieval for large catalogs.
Store richer product metadata in SQLite/LMDB/RocksDB and fetch only the items requested by the UI.
Add admin endpoint to reload model/cluster maps and monitor recommender health.


# Aug 25 updates:
Summary — work completed today

Server

Added paginated /products API (page & size) returning items + total.
Implemented _build_products(limit, offset) to slice recommender.itemidmap without materializing the full catalog.
Made CATALOG_MAX determined lazily from recommender (len(itemidmap)) so the frontend can show total.
Stabilized interaction logging to data/interactions.csv (timestamp, session UUID, event type, item id, history length).
product_page now creates & caches lightweight product stubs in global RECOMMENDATIONS so recommendation links resolve.
Loaded item cluster map on startup and exposed /clusters endpoint (groups PRODUCTS by cluster if available).
Frontend

Added client-side pagination script in index.html: fetch /products?page=N&size=M, render pages, supports page-size selector and Prev/Next controls.
Implemented infinite-scroll fallback and impression logging of visible items via /log_click.
Removed per-card "View" button so cards are clickable directly; card layout updated to avoid duplicate ID display.
Model / data

Recommender still loads pretrained checkpoint (model/gru4rec_torch/output_data/save_model_test.pt).
Cluster CSV (yoochoose_item_clusters.csv) used to help candidate narrowing; catalog metadata kept as lightweight stubs.
Verification

curl /products?page=0&size=10 returns items + total.
Index loads first page and paging/infinite-scroll fetches more.
Clicking recommended items now resolves to product pages (stubs cached), avoiding 404s.
Risks / next steps (recommended)

Add server-side caching and rate-limiting for /products.
Implement popularity-based candidate pools or ANN (FAISS) for large-catalog retrieval.
Persist richer product metadata in a DB/KV store (SQLite/LMDB/RocksDB).
Add admin endpoint to reload model/cluster maps and monitor recommender health.


Làm sao biết được item nào để recommend. Dựa vào gì?

Chung:
Click vào A1 -> Kiếm trong dataset thì sẽ có khúc chứa danh sách những item tương tự: [A2, A3, A4]

Backend lấy ds item tương tự nó trả về.

Frontend hiển thị danh sách item tương tự ấy.

Chi tiết:
app.py có dòng: rec_ids = recommender.recommend(history, topk=6) 

Gọi def recommend(self, session_items, topk=6, exclude_seen=True) từ recommender.py

Trong recommender.py thì có:
class GRURecommender:
self.gru = GRU4Rec.loadmodel(model_path, device=device)

Tải model GRU4Rec rồi gán vào self.gru 

Quay lại recommender.py, def recommend(self, session_items, topk=6, exclude_seen=True)
làm công việc của nó rồi trả về return [str(self.idx_to_item[int(i)]) for i in top_indices]

Gán giá trị trả về ấy vào rec_ids bên app.py

Rồi từ app.py trả về kết quả ở phần frontend:
    # Fallback: if no recs (empty history), show first items as simple recommendations
    if not rec_ids and PRODUCTS:
        rec_ids = [p["id"] for p in PRODUCTS[:6]]
    # Build recommendation objects even if not in PRODUCTS
    recs = [_product_for_id(rid) for rid in rec_ids]      
    log_event("page_index", extra="|".join(history[-5:]))
    print(f"[INDEX] products={len(PRODUCTS)} history={history} rec_ids={rec_ids}")
    return render_template("index.html", products=PRODUCTS, recommendations=recs)


GRU4Rec làm công việc của nó xong, rồi nó trả về kết quả dưới dạng là topk
topk đưa qua frontend để hiển thị sản phẩm được recommend


Client-side clicks call the logging endpoint (see /log_click and the click handlers in index.html / web_demo/templates/product.html).
The server keeps a session history (see add_history / get_history); visiting a product page calls add_history(product_id) so the user’s recent item sequence is stored in session.
The index page builds recommendations by calling the model with that session history: index calls recommender.recommend(history, topk=6) (see web_demo/app.py).
The actual recommendation logic is in GRURecommender.recommend: it
maps item ids to model indices via itemidmap,
feeds the sequence into the GRU to produce a hidden state,
scores all items using the model output weights (Wy / By) via score_items,
optionally masks out already-seen items, and
returns the top‑k highest scoring item ids (mapped back with idx_to_item). See recommender.py.
Summary: recommendations are learned by the GRU4Rec model from training data and returned as the highest‑scoring items given the current session’s sequence of item ids.
